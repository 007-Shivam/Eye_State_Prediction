# Eye State Prediction

This repository contains code and resources for predicting eye states (open or closed) based on EEG (Electroencephalogram) data using machine learning algorithms. The project aims to provide a practical solution for eye state detection, which can have various applications, including driver drowsiness detection, human-computer interaction, and medical research.

## Dataset

We used a publicly available EEG dataset, which you can find [[here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/eye-state-classification-eeg-dataset?select=EEG_Eye_State_Classification.csv)]. The dataset contains EEG recordings of eye states, and it has been preprocessed for our machine learning experiments.

## Machine Learning Models

We have implemented and trained various machine learning models for eye state prediction, including but not limited to:

- Random Forest
- XG Boost
- K Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
